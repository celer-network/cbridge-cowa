# Controllers and interfaces
- controllers are similar to solidity library/parent contract, they can own state and handle read/write.
- unlike solidity, controller funcs MUST be explicitly added in actual contract handle message
- other packages can define contract APIs, similar to solidity interfaces. eg. mint/burn funcs
